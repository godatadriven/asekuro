# Asekuro

A commandline util for jupyter notebooks, possibly to be used in trainings and/or githooks.

> Asekuro means insurance in esperanto. 

![](notebook-img.png)

The main goal is to have a commandline app that can be used in githooks. The main 
features we wanted in this app is that we had a nice way to: 

1. Clear notebook cells 
2. Be able to confirm that the notebook can run without errors.
3. Be able to deal with solutions via `%load` magic.  

# Quick-Start 

Installation can be done via pip. 

```
> pip install asekuro
```

Note that we only support python>=3.6. 

# Usage 

Once installed, the commandline app can be used.

```
> asekuro
Usage: asekuro [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Asekuro - it means insurance in esperanto.

  This command line app allows you to check for errors in jupyter notebooks.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  check	   Check notebook file by following it with a python file with a python file with assert statements.
  clean	   Clean notebook files.
  test	   Check notebook files independantly.
  version  Echo the version of asekuro.
```

#### Testing a Notebook 

We merely test if the notebook can be run from top to bottom without any 
errors. This may be dependant on the virtualenv that you're currently running.

```bash
> asekuro test tests/testnb.ipynb

#### Clean Notebook 

Sometimes you may want to remove the output of the cells. This can be done automatically now too. 

```bash
> asekuro clean tests/testnb.ipynb 
2018-07-30 15:44:23,508 [commandline.py:clean_notebook:76] DEBUG - about to strip tests/testnb.ipynb of output
2018-07-30 15:44:23,516 [commandline.py:clean_notebook:82] DEBUG - tests/testnb.ipynb is now stripped
```

#### Testing 

You can run some unit tests via `pytest`.
